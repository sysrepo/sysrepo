Package: libsysrepo8
Depends: adduser,
         coreutils,
         ${misc:Depends},
         ${shlibs:Depends}
Architecture: any
Description: YANG-based configuration and operational data store - runtime
 Applications can use sysrepo to store their configuration modeled by provided
 YANG model instead of using e.g. flat configuration files. Sysrepo will ensure
 data consistency of the data stored in the datastore and enforce data
 constraints defined by YANG model.
 .
 The library is implemented in C and provides an API for other software
 to use for accessing sysrepo datastore.

Description: YANG-based configuration and operational data store - development files
 Applications can use sysrepo to store their configuration modeled by provided
 YANG model instead of using e.g. flat configuration files. Sysrepo will ensure

 This package contains the C headers, a pkgconfig file, and .so entry point
 for sysrepo.

Architecture: any
Description: YANG-based configuration and operational data store - executable tools
 This package provides the "sysrepoctl" and "sysrepocfg" tools which can be used
 for manipulation of installed YANG modules and their YANG data, respectively.
 There is also "sysrepo-plugind" that is a simple daemon grouping all installed
 sysrepo plugins in a single process.
